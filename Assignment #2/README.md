**Introduction/Methodlogy**

For my UT, I decided to test the usability of the [Allkpop website](www.allkpop.com)Allkpop is an online Kpop news/media community where people can find the newest K-pop related articles and content. Along with an ecommerce site and open forum, this site not only allows Kpop fans to find news but also engage in other fan-related activities to support their artists.

I recorded the screen and the participants' voice using QuickTime player. The session captured the participant's actions as she went through the tasks on the websites as well as her thoughts while performing the tasks.

I gathered users around me who were most similar to the target audience, the Kpop community. Each session lasted approximately 15 minutes. During the session, I, the moderator, guided the user through the questionaire and asked them to perform three tasks that tackled some of the usability issues I found in my heuristic evaluation. Upon finishing the tasks, I asked the users to fill out some questions regarding the tasks on a scale, such as how likely they disagree/agree with a statement regarding the task. Throughout the session, I encouraged the users to speak aloud, and asked clarifying questions.


**Some of the main usability issues I found in my heuristic evaluation was**
1. The confusion with the menu tabs and the overall navigation of the website. I found it difficult to find specific content that I was interested in. For example, if I was interetsed in a specific artist, I would not be able to find their content easily.
2. Error prevention in the comment section.
3. The lack of synchronization between the affiliated ecommerce site and main website. I didn't see the point of having the shopping cart icon on the main website if it only redirects me to the eccomerce site to view my shopping items.

The UT took part in a quiet space in my apartment. I had trouble downloading software that recorded both the screen and the user, so I opted to only screen record and have the voice-over in the background. (which was acceptable for this assignment). Since this is a pilot test, I conducted two trials until the UT session was able to run smoothly.





**Purpose of UT**

Usability testing is a great way to gather user feedback by making them perform tasks and understanding their thinking process. Through usability testing, you can identify possible aspects of improvements on the website that can increase efficiency, effectiveness and satisfication. Based on the user's behavior and thoughts during the usability test, we can observe how learnable and navigatable the website is,and how quickly the user is able to search for content. UT is a great way to test issues with high severity on the heuristic evaluation. For example for my UT, I primarily chose tasks that tested for whether the user can find content specific to their interests quickly, efficiently navigate between the ecommerce and main website, and other features like commenting that I found troublesome during the heuristic evaluation.

I have conducted two trials. The first UT had great feedback, but the survey had some confusing wording and awkward formatting that I then fixed for the second UT with a different user. However, for the final project, I intend on using both users' feedbacks.

**What I learned/Future Improvements**

I had to two UT with two users, because the first UT did not go smoothly. Although the user's feedback was very good and the UT overall was very engaging and rewarding, I did not test the survey beforehand to make sure that everything would go smoothly. I realized that there were errors on the form, and some questions were confusing to the user. So I went ahead and did a second UT with another user and revised some of the instructions on the tasks. Both users were very outspoken with their opinions, and surprisingly, many of their opinions overlapped. While the users were performing the tasks, I became aware of more visual aspects of the website that can be improved, such as color coordination and icon placement. It was also interesting to see how the users approached the first and third task quite differently. To improve my UT in the future, I would invest more time on running trials on my survey to make sure everything is working correctly. Second, I would aim to get users that are closest to my target audience. For this UT, my first user was further from my target audience than my second user. If i had more time,  I would love to have more user input so that I can best assess which tasks are meaningful to perform and observe more UI/UX points about the website.
