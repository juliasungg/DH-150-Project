One paragraph explaining the purpose of UT, how & what you want to test especially based on the findings of heuristic evaluation. 

Usability testing is a great way to gather user feedback by making them perform tasks and understanding their thinking process. Through usability testing, you can identify possible aspects of improvements on the website that can increase efficiency, effectiveness and satisfication. Based on the user's behavior and thoughts during the usability test, we can observe how learnable and navigatable the website is,and how quickly the user is able to search for content. UT is a great way to test issues with high severity on the heuristic evaluation. For example for my UT, I primarily chose tasks that tested for whether the user can find content specific to their interests quickly, efficiently navigate between the ecommerce and main website, and other features like commenting that I found troublesome during the heuristic evaluation.

I have conducted two trials. The first UT had great feedback, but the survey had some confusing wording and awkward formatting that I then fixed for the second UT with a different user. However, for the final project, I intend on using both users' feedbacks.

One paragraph describing what you learned during the pilot test, what went well and what went not so well, focusing on how you want to improve your UT in the future.

I had to two UT with two users, because the first UT did not go smoothly. Although the user's feedback was very good and the UT overall was very engaging and rewarding, I did not test the survey beforehand to make sure that everything would go smoothly. I realized that there were errors on the form, and some questions were confusing to the user. So I went ahead and did a second UT with another user and revised some of the instructions on the tasks. Both users were very outspoken with their opinions, and surprisingly, many of their opinions overlapped. While the users were performing the tasks, I became aware of more visual aspects of the website that can be improved, such as color coordination and icon placement. It was also interesting to see how the users approached the first and third task quite differently. To improve my UT in the future, I would invest more time on running trials on my survey to make sure everything is working correctly. Second, I would aim to get users that are closest to my target audience. For this UT, my first user was further from my target audience than my second user. If i had more time,  I would love to have more user input so that I can best assess which tasks are meaningful to perform and observe more UI/UX points about the website.
