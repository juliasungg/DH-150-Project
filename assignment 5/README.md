Step01: Specify the main design challenge 
What is the main activity your project would support the users?

What is the basic need involved for that activity? (reference)

What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?

Step02: Target users 
What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise) 
Where would the users do that activity?
What would the users do to complete that activity? 

Step03: Pick an observation method (or a combination of methods) 
Interview with direct / Passive / Participatory observation* (recommended)
Or something you learned on your own (refer the field guideline by IDEO)

Step04: Plan to get into the context & write down the observation/ interview guide 
Decide where to visit
Decide what activities to observe/ what to ask to do
Decide how to interact with the users 
Decide how to collect user data (ex. Pen-paper notes, voice/video recording, images)
Prepare the interview guide (refer)

Step05: Conduct the research
Visit the place
Meet/Observe people/person
Collect the data

Step06: Organize/Documentation
In github (sub)repository assignment5, create one document (either README.md or .html)
Describe your project design challenge + target user (step1+2)
Describe your research methods and plan (step3)
Provide a link to your interview/observation guide (step4) 
Digitize your notes (scan/photo) and upload your data to github
Provide a link to your representative data file(s) (step5)
Provide a link to the transcript your interview (or meaningful dialogues/ talk-alouds during observation) 
Write a reflection
