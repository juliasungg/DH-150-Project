## Overview:

The project will allow users to easily browse for news relating to Korean entertainment, including music, dramas, and celebrity news. Those who follow Korean entertainment and culture has been steadily increasing due to the global expansio of Korean culture through movies (Parasite) and music. (BTS, PSY). While my project will focus on appealing to the entire community, it will focus on easy navigation of Korean entertainment news for those who are new to the culture. In this assignment, I will observe the user while she conducts a few searches on the web about her favorite celebrity.

## Resources
In order for the user to succesfully complete the activity, she would need access to a phone or laptop, and reliable internet. 

## Current Solutions
The traditional solutions used to satisfy the need are websites and Youtube. There are many existent websites that acts as a news platform as well as a forum for the Korean culture community to engage in. Youtube is a new and rising solution, as more Korean broadcast stations begin to upload clips of their entertainment news shows/variety shows/dramas to Youtube with subtitles in various languages.

The existing solutions hardly provide personalized and curated content. While Youtube picks up on the users' preferences and provide recommendations,

## The Target Audience

Although Korean culture has a wide demographic appeal, the main target audience for this project would be young students ranging from 13-23 years old who are immersed daily in online content and on-top of the trendiest news. It would be best to interview a group of users who are very fond of Korean culture and entertainment, ranging from older fans to newer fans.
