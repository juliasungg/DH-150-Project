## Explain what we are here for.

Hi, I am going to ask you a few questions regarding your user experience and behavior as a user in the KPOP/K culture community. I will ask you to conduct a few tasks as necessary, and follow how you navigate throughout the web.
	
* Set up Voice Recording/Otter and laptop to take notes on * 

## Please read the following.

"Thank you for participating!
We're not evaluating you in any way, but we're learning from you about how you look for information online and what works and doesn't work for you. With this, we hope we can make our product better for people like you. There are no right or wrong answers to any of the questions I'm asking in this study - we're simply interested in understanding how you do things online. We will conduct this study mostly as a discussion - I will ask you to show me how you do things using this computer and ask you questions to better understand what you do.
Here's how the session's going to be scheduled. We'll ask you a few general questions about how you search and navigate on a Korean entertainment news page of your choice.Then we'll go through some tasks you have provided for us. While you are working on some tasks, we'd like you to think out aloud, which means you give a running commentary of what's going on in your mind. You can talk about things you like or don't like. Feel free to say anything that comes to your mind; don't worry about offending us since we didn't design this product.
We will record a little video of you so that I can go back and review things later and make sure we get everything right. We won't use your name in connection with the recordings or the results. The videotapes will only be used internally and never shared anywhere with anyone.
How does all that sound to you? Do you have any questions at this point?"
