## Hallyou, Julia Sung

As someone who is an avid consumer of Korean media and a follower of Korean entertainment news, I love to spend time throughout the day browsing the internet for the most recent news, updates and recaps of shows.

The project will allow users to easily browse for news relating to Korean entertainment, including music, dramas, and celebrity news. Those who follow Korean entertainment and culture has been steadily increasing due to the global expansion of Korean culture through movies (Parasite) and music. (BTS, PSY). I believe that creating an app that efficiently includes news updates as well as interactive features is a way to satisfy the KPOP/K-culture community's sense of social belonging.

While my project will focus on appealing to the entire community, I will particularly keep in mind those who are new to the culture and frame my project so that new users can especially benefit from the easy navigation and personalization of Korean entertainment news.


## Clear design statement: 

The main issue is the lack of a well organized and easily navigable app for the korean entertainment community. From my heuristic evaluation and usability testing, I saw that the search bar was inefficient because it did not recommend any specific searches, which caused unrelated articles to pop up. It is important to resolve this issue so that users can easily search for content that they are interested in, for example an artist of interest. Another issue 

## Competitor analysis [assignment01 & 02]: Summary and link to the heuristics and usability testing of the existing product(s) - or the original website you evaluated

For the heuristic evaluation, I analyzed two platforms, [Allkpop](https://www.allkpop.com) and [Koreaboo](https://www.koreaboo.com/). Each platform only has a website, and no app. Koreaboo's platform lacks personalization features and overall content and direction. There is no search bar. There’s no indication of which news articles are most popular, or most recent. In comparison, Allkpop has some personalized features through the user account. There are opportunities for user interaction, and the landing page seems like it has clear direction and very user-friendly. The comment section could be more intuitive and direct is if they emphasized logging in before commenting, instead of having it in small font in the bottom corner.

# Usability Testing 

For my UT, I decided to test the usability of the Allkpop website. Allkpop is an online Kpop news/media community where people can find the newest K-pop related articles and content. Along with an ecommerce site and open forum, this site not only allows Kpop fans to find news but also engage in other fan-related activities to support their artists.

I recorded the screen and the participants' voice using QuickTime player. The session captured the participant's actions as she went through the tasks on the websites as well as her thoughts while performing the tasks.

While the user was performing the tasks, I became aware of more visual aspects of the website that can be improved, such as color coordination and icon placement. Some of the main usability issues I found in my heuristic evaluation includes the overall navigation of the website and searchability of specific content. For my project, I will try to synchronize the menu option screens better and include a sort filter for the search based on Popularity, Date or # of comments.

## User research [contextual inquiry, assignment04]: Summary and link to your assignment folder

For user research, I observed my friend, Cydney who fits the description of the main argeted audience, young students ranging from 13-23 years old who follow Korean entertainment news. I observed Cydney while she performed tasks such as browsing the main home page, searching for a specific keyword and attempting to comment. Throughout the process, I encouraged her to speak aloud and asked her clarifying questions to understand her actions better.

She continuously pointed out how the content across major news websites are often disorganized, making it difficult to find personalized content. She also didn't see the point of making an account on the website, since it didn't really change how the content was displayed to her. Throughout the day at school, she would prefer having an app opposed to a website, since a mobile app is easier to open up and navigate throughout the day. Because she often logs into the website a few times a day, she also stated that it would be a nice feature to save articles and videos for later.

## UX storytelling [persona+scenario, assignment05] Summary and link to your assignment folder

I created 3 personas, with each persona performing a different task with a different scenario. All three personas must identify with the target audience of my app. The personas will focus on performing 3 main tasks:
   1. Comment on a post.
   2. Search for specific content and bookmark the content for later read.
   3. Join a forum.

Amy is tasked with a new project at Netflix to research which dramas, movies and shows are most popular. Because Amy is already a fan of Korean community, she has used the platform before. To begin, she looks for content specific to shows, movies and dramas on the homepage. She licks on the “Explore” button and clicks on the ‘TV/Film’ button first. When she is on the page, she wants to look at the most recent news, so she filters by date. The platform will then show the latest news about currently ongoing or soon to be released dramas and movies. In order to read more about the dramas/movie, she clicks on a relevant article. Amy will come across various links in the article, that will direct her to past news about the show that she could have possibly missed. Once she finishes reading the article, she will gauge the community’s opinions through reading the comments underneath the article. She will also post her own opinions, by clicking into the comment bar. The system will prompt a chatbox to remind her that only registered accounts can comment. She will feel unprepared, and proceeds to make an account with the website. She is happy to find that she can proceed to commenting and engaging in forums after she logs in with her newly-made account. Amy finds out that she can also save the article for future viewing!

## Low-fidelity prototype (wireflow, assignment07) Summary and link to the sketches (may contains the multiple versions and evaluation history)

The purpose of this low fidelity prototype is to illustrate the flow of the three scenarios previously mentioned. My low fidelity prototype shows the navigation of screens and their features that the user would have to navigate through to perform the three scenarios. Low fidelity prototypes are useful for user research to examine how a user would go through these screens, and take note of any barriers and improvements.

![Scenario 1](https://github.com/juliasungg/DH-150-Project/blob/master/Assignment%206/Forum.jpg?raw=true)

![Scenario 2](https://github.com/juliasungg/DH-150 Project/blob/master/Assignment%206/Comment%20on%20an%20article%20and%20share%20an%20article.jpg?raw=true)

## High-fidelity prototype (functional/interactive prototype, assignment08) Summary statement and link to or an embedded prototype

Based off the low fidelity prototype feedback, I used InVision Studio to build a high fidelity prototype with the screens, components and interactions. Some important functionalities of the app should include search, comment, share and bookmark.  To personalize the app for the user, I created a user profile section that allows users to bookmark content and engage in forums. To begin the prototype, I made a dummy screen with my choice of color and base components (such as the iphone status bar, menu bar etc) that I can easily duplicate and alter by adding new layers and components. While making this prototype, I focused on making it as simple as possible, since the user already has to navigate through a lot of information.

## Conclusion: what did you learn throughout the process?

Organization is key throughout the whole process. Especially in drafting the scenarios and user personas, it is extremely important to identify the three most important features to focus on for the prototype. Although there are bound to be any other tasks the user can perform,  its important to breakdown the most important steps that goes into a user's completion of a task. Organization is key so that at the end of the process, I am able to see a continouous consistent developement of the project that I can effectively document into a portfolio.
