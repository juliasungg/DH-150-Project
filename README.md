# DH150 Assignment01: Heuristic Evaluation by Julia Sung
As someone who is an avid consumer of Korean media and a follower of Korean entertainment news, I love to spend time throughout the day browsing the internet for the most recent news, updates and recaps of shows. Although these websites aren't recommending or selling anything, the website still interacts with the user through content, ads and navigation. Good UI/UX design will have an effect on on the user's likelihood to revisit the website. I decided to look at two websites: Koreaboo and allkpop.  

The first website I will be looking at is [Koreaboo](https://www.koreaboo.com/). 

<img width="1207" alt="Screen Shot 2020-01-13 at 9 55 34 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55997881/72318848-46b97980-3652-11ea-9e39-808a3429d3f4.png">

In comparison to other websites that exist for the KPOP/Kdrama community, this particular website lacks personalization features and overall direction. Although the website name is creative and most widely adopted, the website does not match the theme the titles  


**1: Visibility of system status**
There’s no indication of which news articles are most popular, or most recent.



**2: Match between system and the real world**

Koreaboo has four headers in their menu bar: Feed, News, Stories, Lists. At first glance, I am confused on the difference between the four options. Without the option to navigate down...

**3: User control and freedom**

To see more content, you have the option to click on “Read More” at the bottom of each page of content. However, there is no option to click on a  “Go Back” button to go back to the past page without using the back arrow on the internet browser. (counter intuitive bceause its located at the top left while we end at the bottom of the page)

**4: Consistency and standards**

The way the articles are chronologically labeled vary. For articles up to a week, its labeled as “ x days ago”. After a week, the articles are tagged with the date, in the Month-Date-Year format.

**5: Error prevention**

**6: Recognition rather than recall**

**7: Flexibility and efficiency of use**

There is no search bar to search for topics that interests the user. There is also no further breakdown of topics underneath the four main menu headers, which deters efficiency since the user is not able to find the content he/she wants quickly and efficiently.

**8: Aesthetic and minimalist design**




**9: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors**

**10: Help and documentation**

There is no way to search 



## Allkpop
The second website I will be evaluating is [Allkpop](https://www.allkpop.com/)

Unlike Koreabook, Allkpop has an additional shopping website, [Shop Allkpop](https://shop.allkpop.com/) where users can buy Korean-culture related merchandise, including fan goods, stationary and apparel.

<img width="1262" alt="Screen Shot 2020-01-13 at 10 47 34 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55997881/72320536-be89a300-3656-11ea-81d9-bf540191b996.png"> 

My heuristic evaluation will be based off of observations of both websites.

**1: Visibility of system status**

Unlike Koreaboo, Allkpop has sections for Best, New and Rising News, making it visible to the users the status of the articles. In addition, they show the status of the page you are on, by highlighting the page you are on in a standout color, red. They also mark the article's rank on each page, with big numbers. 

Overall, I think they did a good job at showing the visibility of the system status.

**2: Match between system and the real world**

There is a slight confusion between the filter/sort features , Feed and Sort. 

**3: User control and freedom**

**4: Consistency and standards**
repetitive buttons, rather instill a filter to filter best news by date or comments or most viewed etc.
i dont get why new will be filtered by any other 

**5: Error prevention**
Allkpop: When the user tries to comment on a post without logging in, the comment section is shaded light grey, with a reminder to "Log in to comment" in the bottom right. What would have been more intuitive and direct is if they put that exact text inside the greyed-out comment section to avoid confusion.

**6: Recognition rather than recall**
repetitive 
recently viewed items on the shopping website
Amazon (and many other ecommerce websites) shows users lists of items that they visited recently. These lists help users remember to finish a purchase that they may have started a few days ago. They promote recognition, because users don’t need to remember interesting information that they may have seen in the past or recall what that product might have been called.
