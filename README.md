# DH150 Assignment01: Heuristic Evaluation by Julia Sung
As someone who is an avid consumer of Korean media and a follower of Korean entertainment news, I love to spend time throughout the day browsing the internet for the most recent news, updates and recaps of shows. Although these websites aren't recommending or selling anything, the website still interacts with the user through content, ads and navigation. Good UI/UX design will have an effect on on the user's likelihood to revisit the website. I decided to look at two websites: Koreaboo and allkpop.  

The first website I will be looking at is [Allkpop](https://www.allkpop.com/).

The second website will also be an Allkpop-affiliated e-commerce website that focuses on selling merchandise and goods.

My heuristic evaluation will be based off of observations of both websites.


**1: Visibility of system status**
Allkpop has sections for Best, New and Rising News, making it visible to the users the status of the articles. In addition, they show the status of the page you are on, by highlighting the page you are on in a standout color, red. They also mark the article's rank on each page, with big numbers. 

Overall, I think they did a good job at showing the visibility of the system status.

Severity: 1



**2: Match between system and the real world**



**3: User control and freedom**



**4: Consistency and standards**
There are repetitive Repetitive buttons, rather instill a filter to filter best news by date or comments or most viewed etc.
i dont get why new will be filtered by any other 

**5: Error prevention**
Allkpop: When the user tries to comment on a post without logging in, the comment section is shaded light grey, with a reminder to "Log in to comment" in the bottom right. What would have been more intuitive and direct is if they put that exact text inside the greyed-out comment section to avoid confusion.




**6: Recognition rather than recall**



**7: Flexibility and efficiency of use**



**8: Aesthetic and minimalist design**



**9: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors**



**10: Help and documentation**





## Allkpop Shop
The second website I will be evaluating is [Shop Allkpop](https://www.shop.allkpop.com/)
This is a website also hosted by Shop Allkpop, where users can buy Korean-culture related merchandise, including fan goods, stationary and apparel.

**1: Visibility of system status**




**2: Match between system and the real world**

There is a slight confusion between the filter/sort features , Feed and Sort. 

**3: User control and freedom**
Allkpop Shop: If I accidentally removed an item from my cart, there is no way to undo my action.

**4: Consistency and standards**


**5: Error prevention**


**6: Recognition rather than recall**

Many ecommerce websites shows users lists of items that they searched/bought recently. This increases recognition, because users aren't forced to recall what they were looking for before, and almost encourages the user to finish a purchase.

Severity: 3

**7: Flexibility and efficiency of use**
The user is not able to see a preview of the items in their shopping cart without leaving the page. It would be more efficient for new shoppers, who are unsure of what they are looking for, to view the items in their carts while they are continuously browsing the page for more items. In addition, there is no way for the user to select which "Best Sellers" category they are interested in.

Severity: 3

**8: Aesthetic and minimalist design**

The website design is pretty simple, with a minimal color palette that provides the right emphasis.

Severity: 1

**9: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors**


Allkpop: When the user tries to comment on a post without logging in, the comment section is shaded light grey, with a reminder to "Log in to comment" in the bottom right. What would have been more intuitive and direct is if they put that exact text inside the greyed-out comment section to avoid confusion.

Severity: 2

**10: Help and documentation**
There is no clear 'Help" or "Contact us" section. There is a FAQ hidden in the "Shipping and Returns" section. I think it would be useful to include a separate "Contact Us" section where the user can submit an inquiry about their order and merchandise.

Severity: 2
