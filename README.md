# DH150 Assignment01: Heuristic Evaluation by Julia Sung
As someone who is an avid consumer of Korean media and a follower of Korean entertainment news, I love to spend time throughout the day browsing the internet for the most recent news, updates and recaps of shows. Although these websites aren't recommending or selling anything, the website still interacts with the user through content, ads and navigation. Good UI/UX design will have an effect on on the user's likelihood to revisit the website. I decided to look at two websites: Koreaboo and allkpop.  

The first website I will be looking at is [Koreaboo](https://www.koreaboo.com/). 

<img width="1207" alt="Screen Shot 2020-01-13 at 9 55 34 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55997881/72318848-46b97980-3652-11ea-9e39-808a3429d3f4.png">

In comparison to other websites that exist for the KPOP/Kdrama community, this particular website lacks personalization features and overall direction. Although the website name is creative and most widely adopted, the website does not match the theme the titles  


**1: Visibility of system status**
There’s no indication of which news articles are most popular, or most recent. Although the current page the user is on is bolded, it could be made more visible with a different accent/color.

Severity: 2



**2: Match between system and the real world**

Koreaboo has four headers in their menu bar: Feed, News, Stories, Lists. At first glance, I am confused on the difference between the four options. Without the option to see subsections underneath these headers, it is confusing what "Lists" refers to. After observing the content, a more fit title would be "Rankings" or "Opinions".

Severity: 1

**3: User control and freedom**

To see more content, you have the option to click on “Read More” at the bottom of each page of content. However, there is no option to click on a  “Previous” button to go back to the previous page without using the back arrow on the internet browser. (counter intuitive bceause its located at the top left while we end at the bottom of the page)

Severity: 1

**4: Consistency and standards**

I found that 

**5: Error prevention**



**6: Recognition rather than recall**
There is no 


**7: Flexibility and efficiency of use**

I like that there is a Home tab for the most recent news and also a separate Discover page to search for content that the user is interested in. An improvement I would suggest is that 

Severity: 3  

**8: Aesthetic and minimalist design**

Soompi: On the Discover page, the images for the categories are quite irrelevant to the categories themselves. They are all pictures of some korean celebrity, and there's no clear reason for using those images. A better alternative would be to discard the images completely, and keep the icons only.

Severity: 2





**9: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors**

**10: Help and documentation**

There is no way to ask for help on the app. Commonly, the help/faq section is found in the settings. However, this is not the case in this app.



## Allkpop
The second website I will be evaluating is [Allkpop](https://www.allkpop.com/)


<img width="1254" alt="Screen Shot 2020-01-13 at 9 55 46 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55997881/72318936-8bddab80-3652-11ea-9f1e-3367c620bb86.png">

Unlike Koreabook, Allkpop has an additional shopping website, [Shop Allkpop](https://shop.allkpop.com/) where users can buy Korean-culture related merchandise, including fan goods, stationary and apparel.

My heuristic evaluation will be based off of observations of both websites.

**1: Visibility of system status**

Unlike Koreaboo, Allkpop has sections for Best, New and Rising News, making it visible to the users the status of the articles. In addition, they show the status of the page you are on, by highlighting the page you are on in a standout color, red. They also mark the article's rank on each page, with big numbers. 

Overall, I think they did a good job at showing the visibility of the system status.

**2: Match between system and the real world**

There is a slight confusion between the filter/sort features , Feed and Sort. 

**3: User control and freedom**
Allkpop Shop: If I accidentally removed an item from my cart, there is no way to undo my action.

**4: Consistency and standards**
repetitive buttons, rather instill a filter to filter best news by date or comments or most viewed etc.
i dont get why new will be filtered by any other 

**5: Error prevention**
Allkpop: When the user tries to comment on a post without logging in, the comment section is shaded light grey, with a reminder to "Log in to comment" in the bottom right. What would have been more intuitive and direct is if they put that exact text inside the greyed-out comment section to avoid confusion.

**6: Recognition rather than recall**

Allkpop Shop: Many ecommerce websites shows users lists of items that they searched/bought recently. This increases recognition, because users aren't forced to recall what they were looking for before, and almost encourages the user to finish a purchase.


**7: Flexibility and efficiency of use**
Shop Allkpop : The user is not able to see a preview of the items in their shopping cart without leaving the page. It would be more efficient for new shoppers, who are unsure of what they are looking for, to view the items in their carts while they are continuously browsing the page for more items. In addition, there is no way for the user to select which "Best Sellers" category they are interested in.

**8: Aesthetic and minimalist design**

The website design is pretty simple, with a minimal color palette that creates the rightemphasis

**9: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors**

**10: Help and documentation**
