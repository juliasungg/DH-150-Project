## Hallyou, Julia Sung

As someone who is an avid consumer of Korean media and a follower of Korean entertainment news, I love to spend time throughout the day browsing the internet for the most recent news, updates and recaps of shows.

The project will allow users to easily browse for news relating to Korean entertainment, including music, dramas, and celebrity news. Those who follow Korean entertainment and culture has been steadily increasing due to the global expansion of Korean culture through movies (Parasite) and music. (BTS, PSY). I believe that creating an app that efficiently includes news updates as well as interactive features is a way to satisfy the KPOP/K-culture community's sense of social belonging.

While my project will focus on appealing to the entire community, I will particularly keep in mind those who are new to the culture and frame my project so that new users can especially benefit from the easy navigation and personalization of Korean entertainment news.


## Clear design statement: 

What is the issue and Why do you think it is important to resolve that issue by your project?

The main issue is the lack of a well organized and easily navigable app for the korean entertainment community. From my heuristic evaluation and usability testing, I saw that the search bar was inefficient because it did not recommend any specific searches, which caused unrelated articles to pop up. It is important to resolve this issue so that users can easily search for content that they are interested in, for example an artist of interest. Another issue 

## Competitor analysis [assignment01 & 02]: Summary and link to the heuristics and usability testing of the existing product(s) - or the original website you evaluated

For the heuristic evaluation, I analyzed two platforms, [Allkpop](https://www.allkpop.com) and [Koreaboo](https://www.koreaboo.com/). Each platform only has a website, and no app. Koreaboo's platform lacks personalization features and overall content and direction. There is no search bar. Thereâ€™s no indication of which news articles are most popular, or most recent. In comparison, Allkpop has some personalized features through the user account. There are opportunities for user interaction, and the landing page seems like it has clear direction and very user-friendly. The comment section could be more intuitive and direct is if they emphasized logging in before commenting,  instead of having it in small font in the bottom corner.

## User research [contextual inquiry, assignment04]: Summary and link to your assignment folder

For user research, I observed my friend, Cydney who fits the description of the main argeted audience, young students ranging from 13-23 years old who follow Korean entertainment news. I observed Cydney while she performed tasks such as browsing the main home page, searching for a specific keyword and attempting to comment. Throughout the process, I encouraged her to speak aloud and asked her clarifying questions to understand her actions better.

## UX storytelling [persona+scenario, assignment05] Summary and link to your assignment folder

I created 3 personas, with each persona performing a different task with a different scenario. All three personas must identify with the target audience of my app. The personas will focus on performing 3 main tasks:
   1. Comment on a post.
   2. Search for specific content and bookmark the content for later read.
   3. Join a forum.

## Low-fidelity prototype (wireflow, assignment07) Summary and link to the sketches (may contains the multiple versions and evaluation history)



## High-fidelity prototype (functional/interactive prototype, assignment08) Summary statement and link to or an embedded prototype

The app will provide the Korean entertainment fan community a place to browse for news articles of their interest. Therefore, the home screen will host the main news feed and search bar. Some important functionalities of the app should include search, comment, share and bookmark.  To personalize the app for the user, I created a user profile section that allows users to bookmark content and engage in forums. To begin the prototype, I made a dummy screen with my choice of color and base components (such as the iphone status bar, menu bar etc) that I can easily duplicate and alter by adding new layers and components. While making this prototype, I focused on making it as simple as possible, since the user already has to navigate through a lot of information.
